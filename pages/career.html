            Ever feel like your career is just... stuck?
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
            Maybe it’s a promotion that never came, a layoff you didn’t see coming, or a project that didn’t go anywhere. Suddenly, you’re left wondering, “What now?”
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
            The truth is most of us are waiting. Waiting for someone else to notice us. Waiting for a recruiter to call.  Waiting for the next big opportunity to magically appear.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
            But waiting doesn’t work.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
            And when nothing changes, the frustration starts to build.

            You tell yourself to hang in there. One more project. One more networking event.

            “Am I stuck? What if this is far as I go?
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">Then the doubts start to creep in:</p>
        <ul class="content-list">
            <li>“Am I even relevant anymore?”</li>
            <li>“Should I settle for something I don’t want to just to keep the lights on?”</li>
